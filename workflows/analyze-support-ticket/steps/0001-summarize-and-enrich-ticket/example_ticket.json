  "description": "We're seeing intermittent 503 errors from the API Gateway endpoints in the production environment. This started occurring around 2:30 PM EST. The errors seem to happen every 15-20 minutes and last for about 30 seconds. Our monitoring shows increased latency during these periods. This is affecting approximately 10% of our API requests.\n\nError rate metrics:\n- Normal: 0.1% error rate\n- During incidents: 15-20% error rate\n\nWe've already checked our application logs and don't see any corresponding errors on our side. The issues seem to be occurring at the API Gateway level.",
